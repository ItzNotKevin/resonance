# YouTube Preview Setup

This guide will help you use YouTube previews as a fallback when Spotify previews are not available.

## ✅ No Setup Required!

The YouTube integration is **completely free** and **requires no API key** or setup!

It uses web scraping to search YouTube, so there are:
- ❌ **No API keys needed**
- ❌ **No quotas or limits** (reasonable usage)
- ❌ **No Google Cloud setup**
- ❌ **No API activation**

## How It Works

When a song doesn't have a Spotify preview:
1. The system automatically searches YouTube
2. Finds the official audio/video using web scraping
3. Uses the YouTube embed as a preview
4. Works for almost any song!

## Benefits

- **Completely free** - No API key or setup required
- **No limits** - Use as much as you want (reasonably)
- **Better coverage** - Almost every song has a YouTube video
- **Better quality** - Full songs instead of 30-second previews
- **Automatic fallback** - Works seamlessly when Spotify previews aren't available

## Limitations

- Uses web scraping (may be slower than API)
- YouTube's terms of service should be followed
- For production apps, consider getting an official API key for better reliability
